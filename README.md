##🔒 Password Strength Checker:

A simple Python command-line tool that analyzes a password and tells how strong it is.

This project is made as a beginner practice project to improve logic building using conditions, loops and string handling.

---

##📌 What This Program Does:

The user enters a password → the program checks different security rules → returns a strength level.

The password is classified as:

Weak 
Medium 
Strong 

---

##🧠 Rules Used to Check Password:

Rule| Requirement
Length| At least 8 characters
Uppercase| Contains A-Z
Lowercase| Contains a-z
Number| Contains 0-9

Each satisfied rule increases the strength score.
